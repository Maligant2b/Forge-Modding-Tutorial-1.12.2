# Minecraft-1.16-Modding-Tutorial

Source code for my 1.12 Forge modding tutorial. If you haven't watched my series, [click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmWBP5ifDlw&list=PLDhiRTZ_vnoX4bx_BJccGV7MjpXUfVJSn). In this series, we will cover building a Minecraft Mod from scratch, starting with basic concepts and working our way through the entire API! 

NOTE: Version 1.12 is no longer support by Forge or the modding community! Please update to the latest version.
